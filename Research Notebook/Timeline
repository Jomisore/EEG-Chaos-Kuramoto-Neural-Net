Research Notebook Entry: Predicting EEG data using Multimodal Techniques
        Date: August 7, 2023
        Abstract:
        This entry presents an outline for the analytical pipeline I will use to analyze EEG data, stim data, and engineer features for prediction models. The aim is to predict EEG data (Y) based on the aforementioned EEG data, stim data, and other features created from the analysis (X).


    Proposed Methodology:

        Step 1: Spectral Analysis
        Starting with a basic spectral analysis to break down the frequency content in our EEG data. This will help in identifying fundamental frequencies and harmonic components present within the data. Included Analysis: 
	

        Step 2: Bifurcation Analysis
        Employing bifurcation analysis. This can shed light on the dynamical nature of the system that underlies the EEG signals. Included Analysis: 

        Step 3: Phase Space Reconstruction
        Phase space reconstruction can provide a broader perspective on the dynamical system that generated the EEG data. Included Analysis: 

        Step 4: Recurrence Quantification
        This technique can provide deeper insight into the dynamics of the system. It can identify whether the system dynamics are periodic, chaotic, or random. Included Analysis: 

        Step 5: Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Modeling
        Using models like the Rossler Attractor and FitzHugh Nagumo Model understand the underlying dynamics of our EEG data. Included Analysis: 

        Step 6: Fractal Analysis
        Employing the Higuchi Fractal Dimension and Multifractal Analysis techniques, we can determine the complexity of the EEG data and gain insights about the self-similarity of the data at different scales. Included Analysis: 

        Step 7: Phase Synchronization and Transfer Entropy
        Understanding the interaction between different channels or signals, we can identify directed influences from one signal to another. Included Analysis: 

        Step 8: Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX)
        Using NARX to create a predictive model of our EEG data. This will be done after feature extraction. 

        Step 9: Hermitian
        Although primarily used in quantum mechanics, Hermitian operators may be useful if we find ourselves doing complex number analysis on the EEG data.

        Step 10: NextGen Reservoir Computing NN and RNN and CNN
        After completing the feature extraction and engineering processes, we will input these features into more complex models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and NextGen Reservoir Computing networks for predictions.
